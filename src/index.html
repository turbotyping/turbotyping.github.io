          <h1>Who we are?</h1>
          <p>
            Web application that will help you learn <b>Touch Typing</b> (also called <b>Blind Typing</b>) which is a style that let you type without
            using your eyesight to find the keys on the keyboard. Every time you look at the keyboard or make a mistake, you slow down you typing
            speed. So to be more productive, it would be nice if you could type fast and accurate and this what we will help you do in this website.
          </p>

          <h1>What you can find in our our website?</h1>
          <p>
            Many apps have been developed to help users improve their typing skills. The difference between
            <b>Turbo Typing</b> and the other applications is that you can improve your typing skills while writing beautiful <b>Quotes</b> and
            <b>Poems</b> and if you are a Software Engineer like me, you can write <b>Java</b> or <b>Python</b> source code. Another important feature
            of the site is the ability to view your typing speed and accuracy and how you have improved. Each typing test score will be saved and you
            can see <a href="/typing-progress.html" target="_blank">graphs of your progress</a>. Last but not least, you can add your own text to type
            by clicking the
            <span class="iconify" style="font-size: 2rem" data-icon="akar-icons:plus"></span>
            icon present in the navbar above.
          </p>

          <h1>How to use your keyboard?</h1>
          <p>
            You need to put your fingers on the <b>Home Row</b>, the one containing the <b>F</b> and <b>J</b> keys. There are small bumps on these
            keys and you should put your index fingers on the bumps. Each finger is responsible for its own set of keys, as shown in the image bellow:
          </p>

          <h1>How to improve your typing speed?</h1>
          <p>
            The majority of people types between 35 and 40 words per minute (WPM) which is equivalent to 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM).
            However, professional typists type a lot faster exceeding 75 WPM. Typing speed generally improves with practice. While practicing, it is
            important to ensure that there are no weak keys. Typing speed is typically determined by how slow these weak keys are typed rather than
            how fast the remaining keys are typed. That's why it is advisable to start by our <b>Training lessons</b> to memorize keys position. By
            default, the <b>Qwerty keyboard</b> is selected and if you are using <b>Azerty keyboard</b>, you can change your preferences to obtain the
            adequate lessons.
